## Platform Comparison

Current platforms suffer from inconsistent fees, operator-dependent rules, and unclear timelines, often leaving users guessing about refunds. [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kuldeep-sangal-16283319_redbus-cancellation-policy-for-travelers-activity-7272556545568075776-Fw2z)

## Gap Analysis

Users struggle with hidden operator fees, percentage-based deductions without examples, and no real-time status updates. Policies bury details in fine print, fail at booking-time previews, and lack progress tracking, eroding trust. [redbus](https://www.redbus.in/info/termscondition)

## TrustRoute Refund Policy

Cancel anytime before departure with simple time-based slabs—no operator surprises. All in plain language.

### Refund Slabs
- **More than 24 hours before departure**: 95% refund (5% convenience fee covers processing).
- **12-24 hours before**: 75% refund (25% fee for last-minute prep).
- **3-12 hours before**: 50% refund (50% fee for revenue protection).
- **Less than 3 hours**: No refund (seat held for you).
- **Bus delay/cancel by operator**: 100% refund + 10% goodwill credit.

**Example**: ₹1000 ticket canceled 48 hours early = ₹950 back (₹50 fee). [getfleek](https://getfleek.app/blog/how-to-cancel-redbus-ticket)

### Deduction Reasons
Only two transparent fees:
- Convenience fee: Covers platform costs (fixed %).
- Cancellation fee: Accounts for lost revenue and operator notice (time-based slab).
No hidden charges—total shown instantly at cancel.

### Refund Timeline
