### Building Trust & Transparency in Intercity Bus Refunds 🚦

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Intercity bus ticket **cancellations and refunds are unclear, inconsistent, and confusing** for passengers.

Today, users often:

* Don’t know **how much refund** they’ll get 💸
* Don’t understand **why money is deducted** ❓
* Don’t know **when the refund will arrive** ⏳
* Don’t know **who is responsible** for delays 🤷‍♂️

This lack of transparency creates **frustration, mistrust, and poor user experience** across public transport booking platforms.

## 💡 Our Solution – TrustRoute
